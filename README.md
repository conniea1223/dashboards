### Dashboards
I visualize work primarily using Tableau and Amplitude. This folder serves as a place for mostly .twbx files, which can only be opened if you also have Tableau Desktop.

I am also developing an easier-to-view portfolio on Tableau Public, at: https://prod-useast-b.online.tableau.com/#/site/conniea1223/projects/394689

However, Tableau Public has major feature limitations (e.g. slow extract creation, no parameters), and any dashboards seen there will not reflect my 'typical' dashboard.
